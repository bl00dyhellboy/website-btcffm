We will meet at "Liegewiese an der Weseler Werft" (`50.10775, 8.70107`, [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/73510354), [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZgMhJbkc1QGWpu38)) next to the European Central Bank.
Make sure to bring blankets to sit on as benches are limited. If you want, also bring a frisbee or similar outdoor games. 
There will be some beers, but probably not enough for the whole evening.
Bring your own food and drinks!

In case of bad weather, we'll go to a to-be-determined nearby indoor place.
